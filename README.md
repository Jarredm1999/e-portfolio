Hello, I am Jarred Myers and I am currently a Software Engineer trying to transistion into Cybersecurity. With a strong foundation in programming and system
        design, I'm building on my techinical background to focus on cloud and
        security. I hold a CompTIA Security+ certification and am currently
        pursuing Microsoft Azure Fundamentals(AZ-900) to deepen my cloud
        security expertise. My goal is to apply both my engineering skills and
        security knowledge to help organizations build and protect modern
        systems.
